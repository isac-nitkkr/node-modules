        `India, the land of seekers, is at the cusp of becoming Vishwa Guru all
      over again after 1100 years of subjugation, wars, annexures and
      humiliation. It is again a free country due to the sacrifices made by our
      leaders, freedom fighters and has learnt the art of standing tall in the
      midst of many a challenge of building the nation with its rich diversity,
      cultures, languages all over again since the last 75 years. Unity in
      Diversity is our mantra while making our nation stronger in every
